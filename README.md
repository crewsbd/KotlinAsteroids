# Overview

Kotlin Asteroids is a game were you see how many asteroids you can shoot before you crash your ship.

I wrote this game as a way to familiarize myself with the Kotlin programming language. I made use of a Java tutorial for making a simple game and adapted it to Kotlin.

# Development Environment

Kotlin Asteroids was written in Kotlin using the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. It makes use of the Java Swing and AWT tool kits.

Kotlin is a relatively new object-oriented programming language. It is built on Java and is compatible with common Java libraries. Kotlin has gained in popularity since it was adopted for use in the Android operating system.
